# youtube-fetcher
This is a simple backend project that uses the YouTube Data API to fetch the latest videos for a specific search query (like "cricket") and stores them in a MySQL database. The project also includes a FastAPI-based REST API to access the saved videos. Optionally, you can connect it with a basic HTML dashboard to view the videos.
